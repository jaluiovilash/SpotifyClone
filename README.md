# Spotify Clone Project

Welcome to my Spotify Clone project! This project is my first attempt at using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a basic music streaming platform similar to Spotify. Below, you'll find information on how to navigate the project, its features, and how to contribute.

## Introduction

This project is a simple Spotify clone created as a part of my journey in learning web development. It aims to replicate some of the core features of Spotify, including the ability to browse and play music tracks.

## Features

- Responsive Design: The project is designed to be responsive and compatible with various screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Music Player: Users can play, pause, and skip tracks just like on Spotify.
- Search Functionality: Users can search for their favorite artists, albums, and tracks.
- Playlist Management: Users can create and manage playlists, add tracks to them, and listen to their custom playlists.
- Audio Visualization: Visual feedback is provided while playing music, enhancing the user experience.
- User Authentication (Optional): Implement user authentication to allow users to create accounts, save playlists, and personalize their experience (Optional feature, depending on your project scope).
